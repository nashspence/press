# Press source format — v2

This is the **normative executable authoring contract** for manuscripts in `press`. The reference implementation is [`scripts/validate_sources.py`](scripts/validate_sources.py), with identifier checks in [`scripts/identifier_schema.py`](scripts/identifier_schema.py) and positive/negative regression cases in [`tests/test_validate_sources.py`](tests/test_validate_sources.py). [`PUBLICATION.md`](PUBLICATION.md) defines official editions; [`REGISTRATIONS.md`](REGISTRATIONS.md) defines the external-identifier registry.

## Required and permitted manuscript fields

Each work lives at `works/<slug>/manuscript.md`. Its YAML front matter must begin at byte zero with `---`, end with `---`, then have **exactly one blank line** before the Markdown body. There may be at most 128 front-matter lines. The seven required fields below are the only required fields; there are **exactly two optional fields**. All fields other than `identifiers` are nonempty, single-line YAML strings. Field order is free.

| Field | Required | Rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schema` | Yes | Exactly `press.work.v2` |
| `title` | Yes | Exactly equals the manuscript's rendered plain-text H1 |
| `author` | Yes | Nonempty string |
| `slug` | Yes | Must equal the lowercase hyphenated `works/<slug>/` directory |
| `language` | Yes | Two- or three-letter lowercase language code, optionally `-XX` region (syntax only) |
| `status` | Yes | Exactly `draft` (formal publication belongs to releases) |
| `rights` | Yes | One of `all-rights-reserved`, `CC-BY-4.0`, `CC-BY-ND-4.0`, `CC-BY-NC-ND-4.0`, `CC0-1.0` |
| `author_orcid` | No | Canonical bare ORCID, e.g. `0000-0002-1825-0097`; ISO 7064 check digit validated |
| `identifiers` | No | Nonempty two-space-indented mapping; only the four work identifiers below |

The optional `identifiers` mapping permits **only**:

| Identifier key | Purpose and canonical form |
| --- | --- |
| `concept_doi` | Registered DOI for the evolving *work across editions*: lowercase bare DOI such as `10.5281/zenodo.1234567`, not a URL |
| `arxiv` | Base (unversioned) arXiv identifier, e.g. `2501.01234` or `hep-th/9901001`, without `arXiv:` |
| `openalex` | OpenAlex work ID, e.g. `W2741809807` |
| `wikidata` | Wikidata work Q-ID, e.g. `Q123456` |

These are **real external registry identifiers**. Never invent or reserve them by placing arbitrary values in source. Omit fields until actually assigned or indexed. The validator checks formats and relevant checksums **offline**, not whether a registry recognizes the identifier or whether the entity is the intended one.

### Front-matter example

```markdown
---
schema: press.work.v2
title: On Structure and Identity
author: Nash Spence
slug: structure-and-identity
language: en
status: draft
rights: all-rights-reserved
# author_orcid: "<assigned ORCID>"
# identifiers:
#   concept_doi: "<registered DOI>"
#   arxiv: "<assigned arXiv ID>"
#   openalex: "<indexed W-ID>"
#   wikidata: "<indexed Q-ID>"
---

# On Structure and Identity

<a id="sec-1"></a>
## § 1 — Foundations

Let $S$ be a set, and let $x \in S$.
```

Optional identifier lines are **comments in this example**: remove the leading `#` only when the corresponding identifiers exist. Quoted values and comments are allowed. Empty optional mappings are forbidden.

### Strict YAML profile

- Root metadata is a mapping of `key: single-line-string` entries, plus the **one permitted nested mapping** `identifiers:` using exactly two spaces for its entries. No other nesting or fields are permitted.
- Duplicate keys (including nested identifier keys), empty fields, missing required keys, unknown keys, sequences, aliases, anchors, merge keys, directives, custom tags, and multiline/folded scalars fail validation.
- Quote any scalar that YAML might parse as a number, boolean, date, or null. Nested identifier values must be strings, and Pandoc must interpret **every key and value identically** to the YAML parser.
- `author_orcid` uses bare hyphenated form, with a validated check digit. IDs appear as raw registry strings (no DOI/ORCID/OpenAlex URL prefixes). The `identifiers` set is deliberately small and must be extended explicitly in a future schema version.
- A work-level concept DOI is *not* an edition DOI. ISBNs identify publication products and therefore **do not belong** in manuscript metadata. See [`REGISTRATIONS.md`](REGISTRATIONS.md).

## Manuscript body, assets and symbols

All the **v1 source restrictions remain in force**:

- UTF-8, NFC Unicode, LF line endings, no BOM, no trailing whitespace, exactly one terminal newline; selected bidi override/control characters are prohibited.
- Dialect: Pandoc **3.12.1** with `gfm+tex_math_dollars+raw_html+yaml_metadata_block`. The parser must emit no warnings. GitHub's Markdown renderer is not promised to be byte-identical.
- One ATX H1 as the first heading, no skipped heading levels. Every H2–H6 must have a unique standalone `<a id="stable-id"></a>` directly before it or separated by one blank line; other raw manuscript HTML is prohibited.
- Inline math `$...$`; display math uses paired `$$` on separate lines. Rendered MathML is checked. Use literal Unicode for prose symbols and mathematical TeX for mathematics.
- Footnote definitions and references must match. Local links point to tracked files; fragments resolve. External text links allow `https:` or `mailto:`. External images are prohibited.
- Local images must be under `works/<slug>/assets/` and have descriptive alt text; allowed formats: PNG, JPEG, WebP, passive SVG, each at most 10 MiB. Asset names use restricted lowercase ASCII characters.
- Each work directory contains `manuscript.md`, optionally `README.md` and assets only. There is no `metadata.json`.

## Executable validation

CI runs on pushes, pull requests and manual dispatch, validating the **entire tracked tree**, not just changed files:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 scripts/validate_sources.py
```

The validator checks source, metadata, Pandoc interpretation, HTML5/MathML, assets and external-identifier **syntax**. It additionally validates any tracked external registry records as specified in [`REGISTRATIONS.md`](REGISTRATIONS.md). CI pins Pandoc 3.12.1 and PyYAML 6.0.3.

A passing CI job alone does not protect `main`; configure an active GitHub ruleset requiring `Validate manuscript sources` and pull-request review. It does not prove authorship, registry ownership/existence, mathematical truth, external URL availability, accessibility, or that a release asset exists. Official release gating and artifact provenance remain separate work.
